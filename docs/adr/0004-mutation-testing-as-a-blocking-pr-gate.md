# 0004 — Mutation testing as a blocking PR gate

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-20

## Context

Line coverage answers "was this line executed?", not "would a test notice if the code broke?". That
gap matters most for **AI-assisted tests**, which reliably chase coverage while writing weak assertions
(assert-not-null instead of assert-a-value). A blueprint that invites agents to generate tests needs a
gate that grades *assertion strength*, not just execution. Mutation testing is inherently slower than
unit tests, though, so the gate must stay a guardrail, not a tollbooth — it must not become the thing
that stalls merges.

## Decision

We run **PIT (pitest)** as a **blocking gate** with a mutation threshold of `80`, configured as the
`pitest-maven` plugin in `service/app/pom.xml` and run via
`mvn -pl service/app -am test-compile org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`.

- **On PRs it runs diff-scoped.** `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` computes the backend `*.java` files
  the PR changed (from `pull_request.base.sha`), maps them to `io.miragon.blueprint.<pkg>.<File>*`, and
  passes them to pitest via `-Ppit-diff -DtargetClasses`. It blocks the PR on the changed classes' score
  but stays off the critical path, and is skipped when a PR touches no backend code.
- **Nightly runs the full sweep.** `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` mutates the whole
  `io.miragon.blueprint.*` module with no property override — the authoritative gate-80 run — and
  uploads the HTML report as an artifact.
- Both runs **exclude noise**: the generated `*ProcessApi`, the Spring bootstrap and
  `BikeCatalogueSeeder`, and the `adapter.inbound.operaton.*` delegates/listeners (thin glue exercised
  only by the slow engine tests).
- The **kill-set** is the fast Mockito / `@WebMvcTest` / `@DataJpaTest` unit tests; the engine
  integration tests (`process.*`) and the ArchUnit/Checkstyle tests (`architecture.*`) are excluded from
  the kill-set — they'd make every run slow and non-deterministic without adding mutation signal.

**Why 80 and not 100:** PIT mutates JVM bytecode, and some of what the compiler and Java `record`s emit
— generated accessors, `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`, canonical-constructor null checks — are
*equivalent mutants* that no test can kill. A residual set of those survivors is unavoidable, so 100%
isn't a realistic target; 80 is the honest bar.

**What a weak test looks like** (the two patterns the gate caught in this repo's own spike): a test
that asserts too few of a DTO's fields — PIT blanks the unasserted ones (`return ""`) and every test
stays green; and a test that exercises only one branch of a boolean — the *"always return true"*
mutant is then *equivalent* to the original. Both are fixed by asserting **every** mapped field and
**both** outcomes of each branch — one assertion per outcome, not per method.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** AI-generated tests are graded on whether they'd catch a real fault; weak assertions
  surface as surviving mutants with per-mutant, inline feedback — at PR time, on the code the PR
  changed.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** mutation testing is slower than unit tests, hence the diff-scoped PR run
  and the separate nightly full sweep. Gate-80 over a single changed class is stricter granularity than
  over the module, so a PR touching only an equivalent-mutant-heavy class (e.g. a thin `record`) can dip
  below 80 (fix: assert every field and both branches, or exclude the class). The threshold is capped
  below 100 by unavoidable equivalent-mutant noise.
- **Neutral:** raising the bar toward 100 is a documented upgrade path — pruning the equivalent-mutant
  survivors (excluding generated `record` members, or narrowing the active mutators) would let the
  threshold rise.

## Implementation notes

- `service/app/pom.xml` configures the `pitest-maven` plugin; with no target-classes override it uses
  full-module scope (the nightly sweep and local runs), and `failWhenNoMutations` is `false`
  so a PR whose changed classes are all excluded/non-mutable doesn't fail the build.
- Do **not** rename the `Mutation testing (PIT, gate 80)` job in `pre-merge.yml` — it is the
  branch-protection required check.
