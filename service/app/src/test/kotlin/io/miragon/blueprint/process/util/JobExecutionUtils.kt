 * process and fails loudly (no job found) if the expected continuation is missing — which is the
 * safer, more readable choice for the deterministic, linear parts of a flow.
 *
 * The `camunda:asyncAfter` flags in the model create exactly these jobs after each step, and the job
 * executor is disabled in tests, so the test drives them by hand.
